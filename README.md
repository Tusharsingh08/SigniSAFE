# SigniSAFE

SigniSAFE is a Python-based tool designed to simplify and secure the process of signing, verifying, and managing digital files or messages. Whether you're working with cryptographic keys, authentication flows, or audit trails, this solution aims to make signature operations smooth and reliable.

## 🔹 Features

- Generate cryptographic key pairs (e.g., Ed25519, RSA)
- Sign files, messages, or payloads
- Verify signatures to ensure authenticity and integrity
- Store or export public keys for trust distribution
- CLI and/or library interface for flexible integration
- Logging of signature events with timestamps

## 🧩 Libraries Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- `cryptography` – for key generation and signature handling
- `click` or `argparse` – for building the CLI (adjust if you use something else)
- `logging` – for event recording
- `os`, `pathlib`, `json` – for file and metadata handling
